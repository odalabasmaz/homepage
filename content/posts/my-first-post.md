This is the first post written under my new home page.
It's 100% build with [GoHuho](https://gohugo.io/).

For a while, I was considering to renew my personal homepage.
After figuring out how much easy to build a static website with *GoHugo*, I decided to give it a try.

Long story short, I've discovered GoHuho and its features. Then, tried out some themes and decided on [LordMathis](https://github.com/LordMathis/hugo-theme-nix/) which is a simple and minimal one.

Finally, I've migrated previous blogs posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/@odalabasmaz).

And, here we go!
